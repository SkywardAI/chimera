# chimera

Chimera is a practical demonstration of how to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) as the backbone of an API server. By transforming incoming API requests into prompts suitable for LLMs, Chimera showcases the potential of AI-driven applications.

This repository provides a hands-on example of:

- Prompt Engineering: Crafting effective prompts to elicit desired responses from the LLM.
- API Design: Structuring APIs to seamlessly integrate with LLM capabilities.
- LLM Integration: Connecting the API to LLM providers like OpenAI or Hugging Face.

Key Features:

Flexible Prompting: Customizable prompt templates to adapt to various API endpoints and use cases.
Robust Error Handling: Mechanisms to gracefully handle LLM errors and API failures.
Efficient Request-Response Cycles: Optimized processing to deliver timely API responses.
By exploring Chimera, you'll gain insights into building intelligent, LLM-powered applications that can revolutionize your development projects.
